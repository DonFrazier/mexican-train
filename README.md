# Mexican Train
Guidelines for playing Mexican Train.
There are no "official" rules, just the House Rules in the house where the tiles are shuffled and laid end to end until someone runs out.

I compiled these guidelines from a number of different rules distributed with domino sets, published on multiple websites and wikipedia.
Feel free to pick and choose your rules from these options.
I tried to explain the options as I understand them.
You are always free to change the rules in your house, just a long as everyone knows the rules before play begins.
In my house, I want everyone to have fun and use some different options than others.
Now lets get going.

# Back Story
Oh!
You're still reading.
Good.
This repo appeared as the direct result of a game I played with my in-laws.
I was about to win when David called "Uno" on me and forced me to draw two additional tiles.
I challenged him on this crazy rule from a card game being applied to a domino game.
David produced the (not related) David Galt 1994 Cardinal version of Mexican Train rules and sure enough, "*A player who has played all of his/her[sic] tiles but one, is required to tell all the other players that ONE tile is left in their hand.*" was there in black and white.
Words commenced as I stated that **my** set did not have that rule and furthermore only idiots would apply card game rules to dominos and that must have been a misprint in a just a few retail sets.
Not to mention there is no mention of having to draw ANY tiles as a result of being about to win.

I searched for the "official" Mexican Train rules to try to prove I was right about not having to call **UNO** since the text clearly said **ONE** in all caps.
I was partially correct.
As often happens I learned something.
The something I learned is that Mexican Train is like home cookin':  Mom's turkey stuffing, bread, and fried chicken are different depending on whose Mom and whose house the stuffing, bread and chicken are stuffed, kneaded and fried.

To date I have discovered nearly 30 slightly different but clearly recognizable rule sets that are all (... well *mostly* all) fun ways to play Mexican Train.
I set out to document all the options I found in hopes of distilling a set of guidelines I could codify into **The Ultimate Mexican Train Online Extravaganza** app where people could hop on a Mexican Train with other passengers anywhere in the world using their very own set of private rules!
Well that is one run-on sentence my grammar teacher would use an entire red pen to dress me down and it is also still a to-do item in my vast free time I now have since I retired.

So ... browse through these pages.
Forgive my typos.
Participate in the discussions.
Try some of the variations that span the globe.
One day I hope to make it to Carriacou and lay tiles on **both ends(gasp!)** of the Mexican Train.
Check out the **Mexican Train Dominos Group** on that time-wasting book of faces ... er ... meta faces.
Most of all post **YOUR** house rules and have fun!
And if you see David call **UNO**! as loud as you can.
