# Mexican Train
Guidelines for playing Mexican Train.
There are no "official" rules, just the House Rules in the house where the tiles are shuffled and laid end to end until someone runs out.

I compiled these guidelines from a number of different rules distributed with domino sets, published on multiple websites and wikipedia.
Feel free to pick and choose your rules from these options.
I tried to explain the options as I understand them.
You are always free to change the rules in your house, just a long as everyone knows the rules before play begins.
In my house, I want everyone to have fun and use some different options than others.
Now lets get going.
