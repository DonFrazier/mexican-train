# Place Engine

Each round starts by placing the Engine Tile in the Depot.
Which Double is used and the method of drawing the Double are House Rules.
The sequential ascending/descending Engine options are most common.Each round advances to the next Double in order.  

## Discovering the Engine

### House Rule for Discovering Engine
    - [] 👟Engine for the Round is removed from the Boneyard before the shuffle and placed in the Depot
    - [ ] Must be laid from a player's Hand


### House Rule When Next Engine must be laid from a player's Hand
- [x] Round one uses the highest Double in the set.  Each Round uses the next lowest Double.
See [Overview](overview.md) for highest Double
    
- [ ] Round one uses the lowest Double in the set.  Each Round uses the next highest Double.
See [Overview](overview.md) for lowest Double

- [ ] Blank is always the last Engine in the game

To speed play the highest Double after all hands are drawn is the Engine.  The first player asks does anyone have the 12, 11, 10, etc. Double.  This ensures the highest double is selected without anyone having to reveal their held Doubles.  

If no Doubles or the Next Double are/is not held, players draw from the Boneyard until the Double is found.  Drawing starts with the first player -or- all players drawing one Tile from the Boneyard until the Engine is drawn by someone.  Using the Sequential option the First Player draws a domino and drawing continues clockwise until the starting Engine Double is drawn.  This option means the First Player and some others may have more starting Tiles than other players.  Simultaneous draw ensures an even starting Tile count for all players each Round.

Removing the Engine before shuffling the boneyard is a bit faster playing.  The First Player rotates clockwise on each round.  Use a token or the scorepad to keep track of the First Player.

Using drawn dominoes and reusing previous Engine Doubles is a bit faster playing.  Using each Engine Double only once means the used Engines must be tracked.
