# Sample Game

Here is a quick start to help you get to playing.
The rest of this FAQ is to help understand the variations and options.

## Preparation
There are 6 players at the table: Andrew, Betty, Charles, Dixie, Eddie and Francis.

A **[12:12]** set of Tiles is on the table.  All the Tiles are face down forming the Boneyard.

The players shuffle the Boneyard.

Everyone draws their Hand for this Round.

Andrew has the Engine **[12:12]** and places it in the Depot.
Andrew is required to play another **[12:*]** tile.
Andrew delays starting his Private Train and announces he is starting the Mexican Train by laying his **[12:11]** Tile off to the side. 
The Mexican Train is now started and available for all players.
Andrew's Turn ends with the Engine in the Depot and the Mexican Train started.
Andrew laid 2 tiles on his Turn.

It's Betty's Turn.

Betty doesn't have any **[12:*]** Tiles so she needs help starting her Private Train.
However she does have the **[11:1]** and lays it at the end of the Mexican Train that Andrew started on his Turn.
Betty's Turn ends with her not having yet started her Private Train but extending the Mexican Train that now ends with **1**.
Betty laid 1 Tile.

It's Chuck's Turn.

Chuck doesn't have any **[12:*]** Tiles either and will need help starting his Private Train.
It's a bad day for Chuck since Betty played **her** **11** on the Mexican Train and Chuck does not have a **1** Tile.
Chuck reaches into the Boneyard and draws one Tile.
Chuck's day is getting better since his draw is the **[12:0]** and he starts his Private Train.
Chuck's Turn ends but his Hand still has the same Tiles that he originally drew.

It's Dixie's Turn.

Dixie is in the same situation as Chuck.
Dixie has to draw from the Boneyard but does not get a **12** to start her own train or a **1** to play on the Mexican Train.
Dixie adds the Tile she drew to her Hand and places a marker on her Private Train.
Dixie's Turn ends with her Private Train Marked and she has one more Tile and she drew.
Dixie's Line is now Public because it has a Marker at the Depot.
Dixie's situation is not necessarily bad because she needed someone to start her train anyway.

It's Eddie's Turn.

Eddie has multiple options and also has multiple **12** tiles.
Eddie could start Dixie's train and get a high counter out of his Hand.
Eddie could also start his own Private Train but might not have another chance to lay off an extra **12** Tile.
Eddie could save an extra **12** and try to Derail another player but risks have the **12** in his Empties.
Eddie also has a **1** that would play on the Mexican Train.
Eddie wants to hold his lower count Tiles in case those are his Empties if he doesn't win the Round.
Since it's early in the Round Eddie starts Dixie's Private Train by laying his **[12:2]** Tile on her Line.
Dixie moves her Marker to the **12** Face so **2** is clearly visible to other players.
Dixie cannot remove the Marker on her Private Train until she regains control of the Line by laying a Tile on it.
Eddie's Turn ends.

It's Francis' Turn.

Francis has a lot of options.
Francis has the **[12:10]**, **[2:2]** and **[1:1]** in her hand.
Her face glows since she is about to play 3 tiles and cause havoc for everyone else.
Francis lays her **[2:2]** crossways on Dixie's Line (it's still Marked Public) and moves Dixie's Marker to cover the 2 Face on Eddie's **[12:2]**.
Since Francis laid a Double she must lay another Tile.
Her face continues to glow as she lays her **[1:1]** crossways on the Mexican Train.
There are now 2 open Doubles on the tracks and everyone else starts to groan.
Francis delivers her coup de grâce by starting her Private Train by laying her **[12:10]** on her Line from the Depot.

(aside)
Most rules say that laying a Double requires the player to lay another Tile.
However *another tile* can be laid on any valid train, which is why Francis' face was glowing.
Depending on the house rules **multiple** Doubles may be played *as long as* the player ends the Turn by laying a non-Double or emptying the Hand.
If the player cannot end his Turn by playing a non-Double or going out, then the Doubles must be returned to his hand.

Now back to Francis who ended her Turn with Doubles Open on two Lines and her Private Train started.
Doubles Rules are now effect and the other players groan even more.
Open Doubles must be satisfied (or closed) before regular play resumes.
In turn the next player(s) must satisfy all open Doubles before any other Tiles are laid.
If a player cannot satisfy an open Double he must draw.
If he still cannot satisfy an open Double he must Mark his Private Train and add the Tile to his Hand!
When Doubles Rules are in effect players may lay one Tile at most on each Turn until all Doubles are Satisfied and regular play resumes.
This is the only way players have to try to force other players to potentially draw more Tiles when they otherwise might be able to go out.

Whew!  Everyone had their first Turn with chaos unleashed!

In this example play continues until both (all) Doubles have been satisfied.
The next player must play against an open Double or draw a Tile from the Boneyard to play against.
Players that cannot satisfy a Double must Mark their Private Trains.
This includes Francis if her Turn comes around and Doubles are still open.

Play continues until around the table until one player empties his Hand and wins the Round.
Players add the pips on their Empties for their score that round.
Play continues with the shuffle and draw.
Each subsequent round starts with the next lowest Double.

There are many variations on Drawing, getting the Engine to the Depot, starting Private Trains, the Mexican Train(s), Doubles, going out and scoring.
