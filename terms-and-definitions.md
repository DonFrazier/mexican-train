# Terms and Definitions

I have read a lot of Mexican Train Rules.
While the rules are all very similar they use different terms that all ultimately mean the same thing.
For this repository I note the various names for a thing here.
If you see a term that just says **See something else** that is because I tried to use **Something else** throughout these pages.
I am human.
I may have erred in some cases.
If you need to, you may cancel me for the mistake.
(I don't care about cancel culture.  I took this time to do this because I love the game.  Cancel away.  I'll still love the game.)
