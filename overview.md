# Overview of Mexican Train

## Object of the Game
Play all tiles in your hand and go out each round.

## Scoring
After a player goes out on a round, all other players total the pips on unplayed tiles in the Hand.
A running total is kept until the last round is played.
The lowest score wins.

## Blanks

### Blanks are Wild
Some rules treat Blanks (or 0's) as wild that match any other tile.
When Blanks are Wild and the Double Blank is the Engine for the current round, players may start their Personal Train with any tile.
When Blanks are Wild the Mexican Train must be started with a Blank.
The Double Blank may not be laid against another Double.
Another Double may not be laid against the Double Blank.

#### House Rule for Blanks
- [ ] Blanks are Wild

### House Rule on Blanks Scoring
- [ ] Blank Tile Faces score 0.
The Double Blank scores 0 for the round.
- [ ] Blank Tile Faces Score 25
The Double Blank scores 50 for the round.

### Examples

- A Public Train ends with any non-Blank value like [1:2].
Player holds a Tile with a blank Face such as [0:3].
The blank Face is laid against the 2 extending the train.
The Train now ends with [1:2]&ZeroWidthSpace;[0:3]

- A Public Train ends with any non-Blank value like [1:2].
Player holds a tile with a blank face such as [0:2].
The [0:2] tile can be laid against the 2 in either direction.
The Train now ends with **[1:2]&ZeroWidthSpace;[0:2]** or **[1:2]&ZeroWidthSpace;[2:0]**

- A Line ends with 0 face like [1:0].
Any tile may extend the line.

- A Public Train ends with any non-Blank value like [1:2].
Player holds the Double Blank tile [0:0].
The Double Blank is laid against the 2 and [Doubles Rules](doubles-rules.md) are effective.  
Since any non-Double Tile may be laid against the Double Blank this may let a player disguise how close his Hand is to going out.  
Holding the double blank and any other tile avoids calling Uno when that rule is in effect.
