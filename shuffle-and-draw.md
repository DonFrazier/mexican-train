# Shuffle and Draw

# Shuffle
Each round starts by turning all Tiles Face down to form the Boneyard and shuffling the Tiles.
Shuffling can be formal or informal.
After the Boneyard is shuffled each player draws a Hand of Tiles for the current Round.
Drawing Hands can be formal or informal.
See [Place Engine](place-engine.md) for additional shuffle considerations.

### Formal Shuffling
In **Round one** the First Player shuffles the Boneyard.  All other players wait until the shuffle is complete before touching any Tiles.

In **subsequent Rounds** the winner of the previous Round shuffles the Boneyard.
All other players wait until the shuffle is complete before touching any Tiles.

### 👟Informal Shuffling
One or more players shuffle the Boneyard.

### Shuffling
Circulate the entire Boneyard mixing all Tiles.
Avoid knocking Tiles off the table.
Mix all Tiles at least a couple of times. 

## Draw
After the shuffle each player draws a Hand of Tiles for the current Round.
The number of tiles drawn varies by the number of players and the size of the Tile set.

### Drawing Hands

Without exposing Tiles each player draws the agreed number of Tiles from the Boneyard.
Any Tile exposed by a player must be taken into the Hand for that Round.
If a player draws more Tiles than agreed, unseen Tiles can be returned to the Boneyard.
Having more Tiles increases the chances of matching Tiles on available Trains and can be advantageous.

#### House Rules on Drawing Hands

##### Exposed Tiles
Action if a player exposes Tiles while Drawing:

    [ ] All Tiles already in the player's Hand, if any, are returned to the Boneyard. The Boneyard is reshuffled and a new Hand is drawn.
    [ ] 👟Exposed Tiles are added to the player's Hand.

##### Overdrawn Hand
Action if a Player Draws and reveals more Tiles than agreed:

    [ ] 👟The Hand is played with all Drawn Tiles.
    [ ] The entire Hand is returned to the Boneyard, the Boneyard is shuffled, a new Hand is Drawn.


#### 👟Informal Draw
All players draw Hands from the Boneyard simultaneously.
